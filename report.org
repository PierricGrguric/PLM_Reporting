- attended to Marion Guthmuller's PHD defence 
*** Work Planned
****** DONE learn how to use the expose command properly (ie how to contact a docker)
** Day 5 30/06
- wrote first Dockerfile to learn how to do it

- wrote and build a dockerfile with play framework and webplm(and all packages required), but unable to execute activator run
- pushed it to https://github.com/PierricGrguric/PLM_Dockerfile

*** Work Planned
****** DONE find why activator run doesn't work and fix it
** Day 7 02/07
- found the problem: some dependencies of play framework can't be downloaded

*** Work Planned
****** TODO finish the angular.js mooc
** Day 8 03/07
